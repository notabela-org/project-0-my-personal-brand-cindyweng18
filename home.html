      <ul>
        <li> As you may have notice, I have two last names and I am fluent in both Spanish and Chinese.
          I was born and raised in Colombia (located in South America) from immigrant Chinese parents
          who later made the decision to immigrate to New York City to give their children a better future.
          This is not much of a fun fact but I think it is very interesting!
        </li>
        <li>
          Maybe because of the mix of cultures I have been in, I am very interested on other people's cultures.
          One of my dreams is to be able to travel the world and set foot at least in every continent.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have dyed my hair brown, purple, and blue. And I will keep experimenting with my hair.
